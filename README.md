## Credits

This plugin is currently using a [new API](https://em.0x71.cc/). At the moment I do not know who created it.
This README will be updated when I do know who created the API.

### Lucario's API is no longer used in this plugin.

Thanks to `Lucario ☉ ∝ x²#7902` for creating [the API](https://em.my.to/) that this plugin uses.
